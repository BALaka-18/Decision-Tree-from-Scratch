# Decision-Tree-from-Scratch

Writing a customized decision tree from scratch for a specific sample dataset only. 
Writing the decision tree helped me understand the concept of Gini impurity and Information gain of a decision node.
Questions were tailored according to the dataset. Will vary from dataset to dataset.
Splitting tailored according to questions asked and the dataset.
Further implementing the decision tree to check if classification was successful or not.
